        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          I keep things simple: strong prep, clean strategy, and clear communication. My job is to protect your interests, keep you informed, and make sure every decision is made with the full picture in mind.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Background</h2>
        <p>
          I have spent my career around real estate and development, which means I look at homes through two lenses: how they live today, and how they hold or create value over time. Whether you are buying your next home, selling a legacy property, or trying to understand the best move in a shifting market, I focus on the details that actually matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clients work with me because they want straight guidance, not pressure. I am hands on with pricing, positioning, negotiation, and timelines, and I stay involved from the first walkthrough to the final signatures.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Rooted in Penngrove</h2>
        <p>
          My family and I live in Penngrove, and that connection is a big part of how I serve clients. My wife owns Hello Penngrove, and our lives are tied to the same streets, schools, and small businesses that make this town special. I do not just sell homes here. I know the rhythm of the community and the little things that change how a neighborhood feels day to day.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">What you can expect</h2>
        <p>
          If you are selling, you will get a clear plan, honest pricing guidance, and marketing that feels elevated and intentional. If you are buying, you will get a strategy that fits the market you are in, with clean communication and strong advocacy when it counts.
