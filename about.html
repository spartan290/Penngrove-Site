<h2>Rooted in Penngrove</h2>

<p>
As the Broker and Owner of Penngrove Real Estate, Aaron Loewenthal has built his business around relationships, strong advocacy, and thoughtful strategy. Living and working in Penngrove alongside his wife Kaitlin and their four children, Aaron approaches every transaction with a long term perspective grounded in community connection and trust.
</p>

<p>
His wife is the owner of Hello Penngrove, a local retail business that has become a gathering place within the town. Together their family is deeply invested in the people, small businesses, and lifestyle that make this area unique.
</p>

<h2>Experience Beyond the Transaction</h2>

<p>
With more than a decade of experience across Sonoma and Marin County real estate, Aaron brings a wide perspective that extends beyond traditional buying and selling. His background includes residential representation, investment strategy, development opportunities, and complex off market negotiations.
</p>

<p>
Clients rely on Aaron for honest guidance, creative solutions, and the ability to anticipate challenges before they become problems. Whether advising first time buyers, representing legacy properties, or structuring unique deals, his focus remains the same: protect the client’s interests while creating a smooth experience.
</p>

<h2>A Different Kind of Brokerage</h2>

<p>
Penngrove Real Estate was created to offer a more personal alternative to large corporate brokerages. Every client receives direct communication, clear expectations, and a strategy tailored specifically to their goals rather than a one size fits all approach.
</p>

<p>
Aaron believes successful representation comes from listening first, understanding priorities, and building relationships that continue long after escrow closes.
