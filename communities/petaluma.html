    <h2>What Petaluma feels like</h2>
    <p>
      Petaluma blends charm and convenience. It has real identity, a downtown that people actually use, and neighborhoods that feel established. Buyers who want Sonoma County living with a little more energy often end up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find a more classic, walkable feel closer to downtown, and broader neighborhood options as you move outward. It is a strong choice for people who want community, restaurants, events, and a sense that the city has momentum.
    </p>

    <h2>Homes and property types</h2>
    <p>
      Petaluma offers a wide mix, from older homes with architectural personality to newer neighborhoods, single level options, and properties with more space on the edges of town. The key is matching your lifestyle to the right pocket of Petaluma.
    </p>

    <h2>Who it fits best</h2>
    <p>
      Petaluma is great if you want a strong “town center” feel, enjoy being out and about, and want good variety in housing styles. It is also a good fit for buyers who want access to multiple directions for work, family, and weekend plans.
    </p>

    <h2>How I help here</h2>
    <p>
      Petaluma is all about micro-locations. If you tell me whether you want walkability, quiet streets, newer build, or character homes, I can quickly steer you to the right areas and away from the wrong ones.
